    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the mystery box there is not a plastic crate that distributes water into three tubes.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box with a funnel on top and a tube coming out of it! When water is poured into the funnel it comes out of the box at different rates. In all of the trials, 500 mL of water was poured in and different amounts came out every time; sometimes more, sometimes less.  In order to figure out how the black box works we created our own box and tried to make it operate as similarly to the mystery black box as possible. In our own model we put a plastic crate with three tubes attached to it. When water is poured into the funnel itâ€™s distributed into two buckets and another tube that comes out of the box. When we tested our model we poured 200mL of water into the funnel and less came out each time. Every trial also had a different amount of water coming out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part I</h1> 
    <p>A model is something that is used in order to represent something real. They are useful because they offer an understanding of how something in the real world works; however, modeling the unknown can be hard. In our box we tried to replicate how the black mystery box operated. The point of the three tubes was so that each time we poured in water a different amount came out each time. The plastic box inside our mystery box was what the three tubes were attached to.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part II</h1> 
    <p>My claim is correct because when we tested pouring the water into the box less water came out every time. In the black mystery box there were trials where more water came out.</p> 
    <h1>Reasoning Part III</h1> 
    <p>If the claim stated that there was a plastic crate that distributed water into three different tubes then more water would have come out of the tube in some of our trials. If the fact that water came out of the box less than the amount poured every time was ignored the claim would be true.</p>
