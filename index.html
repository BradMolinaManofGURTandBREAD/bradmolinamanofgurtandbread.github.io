    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the mystery box there is not a plastic crate that distributes water into three tubes.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box with a funnel on top and a tube coming out of it! When water is poured into the funnel it comes out of the box at different rates. In all of the trials, 500 mL of water was poured in and different amounts came out every time; sometimes more, sometimes less.  In order to figure out how the black box works we created our own box and tried to make it operate as similarly to the mystery black box as possible. In our own model we put a plastic crate with three tubes attached to it. When water is poured into the funnel itâ€™s distributed into two buckets and another tube that comes out of the box. When we tested our model we poured 200mL of water into the funnel and less came out each time. Every trial also had a different amount of water coming out.</p>
